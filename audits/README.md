## Contract Summary

The `MPForwarder` contract is a utility smart contract designed to forward both ETH and ERC20 tokens to a specific destination address, which is set upon contract deployment. This address is typically the merchant's address.

### Key Features:

- **ETH Forwarding**: The contract accepts ETH deposits and allows anyone to trigger a flush of the contract's ETH balance to the destination address using the `flushETH` function.
- **ERC20 Forwarding**: Similarly, the contract supports ERC20 token transfers. By calling the `flushERC20` function with the address of the ERC20 token, anyone can forward the contract's token balance to the destination address.
- **Event Emissions**: The contract emits relevant events (`ETHFlushed` and `ERC20Flushed`) to track the forwarding actions.
- **Security**: The contract uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20` to ensure secure token transfers.

### Recipient Address Behavior:

- The recipient address (destination) is the merchant's address, set during the contract's deployment. The contract allows any external caller to trigger the flush functions, which automatically transfer all available funds (ETH or ERC20) to the merchant's address.
